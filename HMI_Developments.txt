Alarms:
  Alarms in the Stopped_Beam area/panel have been reorganized such that all
    To_xxx sections have the same indentation as N4.
  All BSS sections and BMIS (PIS) have had IN_USE pvs made (i.e.
    BSS_BTS03:IN_USE). They're now used as enabling filters for related alarms.
    Changing them from 0 to 1 will enable ILK alarms for the related section,
    and vice versa.
  SUM_STS pvs have been made for all RF cavities, these look at the enabled
    status, the tuned status, whether either phase or amplitude have set/rd
    mismatches, as well as ILK_LTCH_ANY alarm. This summarizes the RF state in
    one maskable PV. Both minimizing complexity of our alarms without
    sacrificing detail, and allowing us to more easily nullify the ILK_LTCH_ANY
    state when the device has been put into it's fully off state. We should pay
    attention to how it behaves when we turn on the cavities this week, to
    verify the enabled states are captured as expected. If so, pitch to remove
    raw ILK_LTCH_ANY pvs that are constantly in alarm.
  Updates that have been made to databases which the alarm server refers to
    for EPICS info, are supposed to have made the server more stable. If
    we see any waves of disconnects, or sporadic re-enabling of disabled alarms,
    we should promptly email Tanvi in High Level Controls. Please cc Crisp &
    Barofsky so that we can follow any work that's done to address things.
  ReA6 F_RD (LCW flow) alarms have been disabled until we figure out whether to
    even expect them.

HMI:
  Added text update widgets on ReA6_Status.opi and FaradayCups.opi that display
    the max allowable beam current for the given beam (using destination
    parameters pulled from hourlog). A HI limit was initially set to 50%,
    while the HIHI is set to 80%.
  So that the beam parameters shown on the ReA6 Status page would not just be
    from the section at LINAC1 exit, but what is being delivered, PVs being
    displayed are ones that pull their values from what is in the hourlog.
  Two of the 'sys_sub:MAG_ALL:SET_CMD' pvs had typos in their related IOC files.
    These typos would have effected the group scaling actions abilities to
    control 2 quads in BTS42, and another 2 in BTS46. This is fixed.
  It was discovered that the PVs which allow you to copy the current hall probe
    reading to the FB Target did not exist. They've been made, and the option
    from the drop down seems to work as expected now.
  Fast acting gate valves located around the CB01 module have been added to
    overview pages.
  energy measurement page has had an extra tab made for use of ReA6 dipole
    D1415.
  We already had a set of PVs that were made to replicate the purpose of our
    dipole-energy-calibration spreadsheet, which converted either field or
    current readings to energy and vice versa. These pvs account for our
    measurement of D1155 dipoles rho. But another set of these pvs has been
    made for the D1415 dipole in ReA6. Because we have not yet measured the rho
    for this dipole, I've made the assumption that we could use the exact Same
    as what we use for D1155 without too much error. I have no issue changing
    it to something else, if there is a better estimation we can use.
  The pvs which enable tasha's magnet cycling application to work have been
    created for all ReA6 magnets. Consider any first use as a test, and let
    Crisp know if there are any issues.
  Labels like CFFD and ATTPC have been removed from overviews, replaced by 'GPL'
    and either BTS45 or BTS31 written underneath. The BTS description has been
    placed under each destination label to help be consistant with hourlog
    destination names.
  In Use checkboxes have been added to the right of each RF Cavity row in
    RF_Main.opi. By unchecking, you indicate that the cavity is not in use,
    and the related widgets get grayed out, and the SUM_STS pv in ALARM_REA
    gets nullified.
  Vacuum station status LEDs in the layout view at the top of Vacuum_main.opi,
    have been edited in the QA area to accomodate the fact that those stations
    have a RSTS with inverted logic compared to the rest of them.
  Disconnects in Vacuum_Main.opi have been remedied by creating the missing
    channels.
  Disconnects related to the Sub Harmonic Buncher (SHB) in RF_Main.opi have
    been addressed by either adding the channels, or removing the widgets.
    Scaling PVs still have to be made, and have to accomodate the unique
    implimentation that enumerates the signal component over that of the device
    in the related EPICS pvs.
  The widgets meant to reflect the yellow beacons for BTS45 & BTS46 end stations
    in ReA6_Status.opi have been temporarily removed from the overview screen
    until we get the correct PVs from controls.

Other:
  hlc_rea IOC has been deployed using procserv. This means all of our IOCs
    are being deployed consistantly on the VM rea-hlapps.
  The package ncsapps-nscl, made by priller to provide us access to panelmate
    again, is made and a ticket was sent to helpme to get it installed on
    rea3-8 and rea3-balcony.
  Priller has updated the BACnet driver in a new water tower IOC. Haven't yet
    checked to see if our resolution and update rate has been fixed.
  All machines have the newest 4.6.3 csstudio, and phoebus installed.
  We're waiting to hear from Joe Ryan and Tom Rockwell about what filepath is
    being given for a shared network drive. This will enable abilities to save
    scan data, to auto-generate beam reports, and save lynx data.
